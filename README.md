# 🏎️ Racetrack Environment & Monte Carlo Agent (Exploring Starts)

## 📌 Overview  
This project implements a **Racetrack environment** and a **Monte Carlo reinforcement learning agent** using **Exploring Starts (ES)**.  
The environment models a racetrack where a car moves based on acceleration commands. The agent learns to navigate the track by optimizing its **Q-values** using **Monte Carlo control**.

A **Pygame visualizer** is included to display the agent’s learned behavior.

---

## 🚦 Racetrack Environment

### 🔹 Initialization  
- The racetrack is represented as a **list of strings**, where each row corresponds to a segment of the track.
- The environment **parses this list** to identify:
  - **Start positions (`S`)**
  - **Finish positions (`F`)**
  - **Walls (`#`)**
  - **Track spaces (`.`)**

- The car's **initial position** is randomly set on a **start block (`S`)**, and its **velocity** is initialized to **(0,0)**.

### 🔹 State Representation  
Each state is represented as:  

```
(row, col, velocity_row, velocity_col)
```
- **(row, col)** → The car’s position on the track.  
- **(velocity_row, velocity_col)** → The car’s velocity in both directions.

### 🔹 Actions  
Actions are represented as **tuples**:
```
(acceleration in row direction, acceleration in col direction)
```
- Each acceleration value is in **[-1, 0, 1]**, meaning the agent can:  
  - **Increase (+1), maintain (0), or decrease (-1) velocity** in each direction.

---

## 🔄 Step Function Execution Order
When an action is applied, the following checks occur **in order**:

1. **Validate action** → Ensure it's within the allowed action space.
2. **Apply random chance of "no action"** → Introduces stochasticity.
3. **Ensure velocity remains valid** → Prevents acceleration beyond physical limits.
4. **Update velocity** → Apply acceleration to current velocity.
5. **Cap velocity** → Prevents excessive speed.
6. **Check if the car crosses the finish line**:
   - If **any part of the movement path** crosses the finish line, **reward the agent and terminate the episode**.
7. **Update position** → Move the car based on velocity.
8. **Check if the car is out of bounds**:
   - If **inside track**, continue.
   - If **out of bounds**, **penalize and restart**.

## 🤖 Monte Carlo Agent (Exploring Starts)

### 🔹 Q-Table Representation  
The agent’s **Q-table** is stored as a **dictionary**, where:

```
Q[(row, col, velocity_row, velocity_col)][action] = expected return
```

- **Keys**: States **(position, velocity)**.
- **Values**: A dictionary of **all possible actions** with their respective Q-values.

### 🔹 Training Process  
1. **Initialize the agent's parameters**:
   - Set **γ (discount factor) and α (learning rate)** to basic values.
2. **Exploring Starts (ES)**:
   - If a state has **not been visited before**, initialize its value using the **mean of observed future returns**.
3. **First-Visit Monte Carlo Updates**:
   - Compute **returns (G)** for each state-action pair.
   - Update **Q(s, a)** by averaging all observed returns.

## 🎮 Pygame Visualization  
A **Pygame-based visualizer** is implemented to show the **agent’s learned behavior**.  
The simulation runs the trained policy, displaying:
- The **racetrack**.
- The **car’s movement** through the track.
- The **decision-making process** of the agent.

---

## 📌 Summary  
- **The racetrack is a 2D grid**, with car position tracked as **(row, col)**.
- **Monte Carlo Exploring Starts** is used for training.
- **Q-values are stored in a dictionary** and updated based on observed returns.
- **A visualizer** is included for monitoring the agent’s progress.

## 🏁 Running the Simulation  
### 📥 Installation  
Ensure you have Python installed, along with the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install pygame numpy
```

### ▶️ Running the Training  
To train the agent and visualize the racetrack, run:

```bash
python monte_carlo_agent.py
```

## 🚀 Future Improvements  
✅ Add **dynamic track generation** for different difficulty levels.  
✅ Implement **ε-greedy exploration** to compare performance with Exploring Starts.  
✅ Improve **visualization with real-time updates** of agent decisions.
